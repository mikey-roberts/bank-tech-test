### Headline specifications - User Stories

Given a client makes a deposit of 1000 on 10-01-2012 \
And a deposit of 2000 on 13-01-2012 \
And a withdrawal of 500 on 14-01-2012 \
When she prints her bank statement\
Then she would see

### Expected Output

date || credit || debit || balance\
14/01/2012 || || 500.00 || 2500.00\
13/01/2012 || 2000.00 || || 3000.00\
10/01/2012 || 1000.00 || || 1000.00

### Further Requirements

* You should be able to interact with your code via a REPL like IRB or the JavaScript console. (You don't need to implement a command line interface that takes input from STDIN.)
* Deposits, withdrawal.
* Account statement (date, amount, balance) printing.
* Data can be kept in memory (it doesn't need to be stored to a database or anything).

### Additional Notes

* The specification does not mention how low an account can go into debit. This is something that could be added as further validation. 


### Outline of design
```
Bank
@account (Account.new)
@statement (Statement.new)

The bank class acts as the UI for the user to interact with. It handles the requests the user can make, such as depositing, or withdrawing funds and requesting a bank statement. Instantiates the account and statement class when Bank.new is called.

Account
@current_balance = 0
@transaction_history = []

The account class manages the transaction requests sent from the Bank class. It calls a debit, or credit method, depending on the input and validates the amount. Next the method instantiates a new Transaction class to store the amount, then saves the amount into the current_balance instance variable and finally a copy of the transaction is pushed into the transaction_history array.

Class - 
Statement

The statement class only focuses on producing the format required for the statment output. Storing a constant for the header value, as it doesn't change and looping the statement body, applying the fields held in the transaction to produce the outputted text.

Class -
Transaction
@date = Time.now
@credit = amount[:credit]
@debit = amount[:debit]
@balance = balance[:balance]

The transaction class stores each transaction that is generated by the Account class. This is to keep track of the type of transaction, it's date, whether it was a credit, or debit and what the balance was at the time of the transaction.

```


### How to clone the Repo
```shell
$ git clone 
$ cd bank-tech-test
```
### Rspec Tests
```shell
$ rspec
```
### Example of how to run the application
```REPL
$ IRB
> require './lib/bank.rb'
> bank = Bank.new
> bank.deposit_transaction(500)
> bank.deposit_transaction(600)
> bank.statement_summary
```


### Headline specifications - User Stories
* All tests passing
* High [Test coverage] (100.00%)
* The code is elegant: every class has a clear responsibility, methods are short etc. 
* Code meets Rubocop guidelines
* Code Follows DRY principle
* Edgecases met
